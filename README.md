# LoRaWAN
The proposed solution leverages LoRaWAN technology to provide reliable, long-range communication between field sensors and the cloud, ensuring real-time data transmission even in remote agricultural areas while simultaneously using LoRa technology to set in house automations for peer to peer communication. By integrating AI/ML model, the system not only optimizes irrigation schedules but also offers predictive insights, helping farmers make data-driven decisions to prevent over-irrigation or drought stress. The cloud-based database architecture ensures that the system can scale effortlessly, accommodating the needs of small farms to large agricultural operations. The solution's emphasis on affordability and sustainability ensures that it is accessible to a wide range of users while promoting eco-friendly farming practices by reducing water usage and energy consumption.
